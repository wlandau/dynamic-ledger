I abandoned this project in favor of ATC (also a GitHub repo on this account) and then simple.com, but I'm keeping it here still because I learned a ton about automake tools in C. Next time I write a C program and use automake for production and distribution, I'll come back tot his project.

Dynamic Ledger is a personal accounting program I wrote in C before I discovered simple.com. If you have bank accounts and one or more credit cards, and if many of the credit card transations are delayed, it can be difficult to do your accounting. How much do you actually have left to spend when some credit card transactions are delayed? Dynamic ledger tries do deal with that problem. See INSTALL, tutorial/tutorial.pdf, or man/dl.1 for details.
