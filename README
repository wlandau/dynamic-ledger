Dynamic Ledger is a program for managing personal finances. Unlike most other accounting programs, it gives you control over your finances even when you have several delayed transactions. With it, you can be exactly as frugal as you need to be, and you can easily avoid spending more than you actually have.

See INSTALL, tutorial/tutorial.pdf, and man/dl.1 for details.
